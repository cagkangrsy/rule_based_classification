# Potential Customer Revenue Calculation with Rule Based Classification

A game company wants to create new level based customer definitions using some attributes of the customers and they want to 
create segments by using the new definitions to finally estimate how much profit can a new customer bring to the company when
compared to these segments.

**Example**: How much profit can the company earn on a 25 year old male iOS user from Turkey?


## Dataset Summary
